# Cibeles Service

I designed a landing page for a technical support company using tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. The website was created to promote the company's services and allow users to request appointments and repairs quickly and easily. The company was very satisfied with the result and this gave me valuable experience in the field of web design.
